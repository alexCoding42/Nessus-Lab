# Building a Vulnerability Management Lab (Nessus)

## Introduction

In this project, I utilized Nessus Essentials to perform some vulnerability scans on a Windows machine, identified and remediated some of them.
First I Set up a vulnerable Windows 10 Virtual Machine, featuring outdated software and disabled security controls. I installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans against the Windows host. Then I analyzed the scan results, highlighting the difference between unauthenticated and credentialed scans. Finally I remediated some identified vulnerabilities, and verified successful remediation through subsequent scans
